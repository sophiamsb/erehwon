        Introduction
        <br />
        <br />
        Internet is everywhere and invisible. Everyone has it and almost
        everybody use it for any purpose. The internet creates in me an
        insatiable curiosity to dive in and to navigate anything available, I’ve
        been quickly accustomed to use youtube , various social media platforms
        in a regular basis which can end to an exhausting feeling of fatigue
        too. Sometimes I reckon hardly a time without a computer , without my
        phone, without internet. I feel like I waste my time, the longer I stay
        on the internet. I’m really busy online. Internet is my daily routine as
        most of my daily routines are based on it. Whether I’m in the train, at
        work, on my bike or at home, I’m glued to my phone, I'm sitting in front
        of my computer all day, questioning google, chatting, sending links,
        reloading my facebook instagram page, checking mails, listening to music
        watching tv shows, interviews, movie scenes and many more things.
        <br />
        Every person in the city can access internet, sometimes there is also
        spots where you can have it for free, it's accessible without much
        difficulties. It has become difficult to escape the connected world.
        Before internet resonated with computers, but now it’s not really much
        the case. Nowadays, most people have at least two connections , a
        computer and a mobile but it can extends to a smart watch, speakers…
        many objects , the internet of things stuff.

        <br />
        <strong>What is it to be immersed in a digital world ? </strong>
        <br />
        <strong>Does Internet modify the human nature?</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        People are nowhere like a fluid living both online and offline realities
        permanently. Actually, why not suggesting the online/offline separation
        is over. Now, everything is about consciousness, at least the illusion
        of it. We are floating avatars, the internet connection opened a reality
        in which people are needy for connection, hyper-micro-split-fake
        identities.
        <br />
        The dualistic concept of reality is the most traditional and convincing
        in our society. It refers to the belief in two kind of reality: material
        /immaterial -physical/spiritual. Because of this concept, the mind is
        categorically separated from the body. So when the question appears, we
        address it to the physical world where our body functions, breathes, and
        navigates. From there, we believe more in a socially shared physicality,
        which can be viewable, hearable, touchable, lickable, smellable, and
        totally experienceable by someone else.In contrast the mental world of
        thoughts, memories,ideas, fantasies, and imagination is considered
        ephemeral and ‘unreal’.

        Virtual landscape. A deserted world filled with a strange series of
        natural/artificial scenes all emptied of human beings.

        The fictional place of Erehwon is being spoken by a virtual avatar. A
        character on his quest and wonder to find his representation in a new
        time-space.
        <br />
        The person of Erehwon is a online-human creature, an hybrid mutated
        version of the old human. His character appears like an avatar, an
        absent human body.
        <br />
        His avatar has appearances, race, class, genders, and personalities that
        is in a constant state of flux. Human is being speed it up. A single or
        several human consciousness being dispersed accross multiple bodies.
        There is no false consciousness.

        I’m ready for somewhere new.
        <br />
        I set up an account and starting creating myself.
        <br />
        I'm me. (depending on which account I’m connected to)

        Are you your friend?
        <br />
        How do you connect with people?

        <strong> monotonous sci-fi landscape</strong>, a seemingly endless
        network of highways and banal office interiors, interviewing a bizarre
        characters on his quest to find his representation in a new time-space.
        The project is meant to create, to show a monotonous imaginary that
        erupts out of the corners of the internet.

        The buildings in Erewhon were bricks and clicks. Foreign alter spaces.
        The dark profundity of depth is routinely contrasted with the
        superficial triviality of the surface. The geoscopic layering of the
        borders.
        <br />
        What we experience as reality are actually collectively agreed upon
        hallucinations. What does it mean for self-representation? Being trapped
        in a world of illusion. We could suppose that the web, for many people,
        feels as real as the real world itself.
        <br />
        We choose those platforms because it is, in our eyes, the core landscape
        of the web. It is crazy to imagine tens of millions of people in one
        place, moving in one direction and it influences more and more the
        experience of internet. (As a matter of fact, It makes people more
        easily controlled and turned users into targets and datas. Internet
        became flooded with ads, where every content is monetized.) The way
        technology is choping traditional jobs into separate tasks which can be
        evaluated and quantified digitally, and put out to tender on the global
        web-market on a weekly, daily and potentially hourly basis. And then all
        the data that we punch into digital platforms and online forms, in the
        name of improving efficiency, ‘feedback’ and customer experience, feeds
        into this loops.

        originate from some place that is completely alien.
